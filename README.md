AtliQ Grands Power BI Dashboard

**AtliQ Grands**

Introduction

Welcome to the AtliQ Grands Power BI Dashboard repository! This project is a response to the challenges faced by AtliQ Grands, a prominent luxury/business hotel chain. In recent years, AtliQ Grands has experienced a decline in market share and revenue due to increasing competition and the need for data-driven decision-making. This comprehensive Power BI dashboard is designed to provide valuable insights and empower AtliQ Grands' stakeholders to make informed decisions.

The Challenge

For over two decades, AtliQ Grands has been a stalwart in the hospitality industry. However, fierce competition and ineffective decision-making have led to a decline in market share and revenue. To address these challenges, the visionary Managing Director recognized the need to infuse "Business and Data Intelligence" into their operations. The missing piece was an in-house data analytics team capable of providing the necessary insights.

The Solution

Introducing our latest accomplishment - a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that brings together critical metrics and insights for AtliQ Grands. This dashboard is a powerful tool that provides actionable information to drive data-driven decisions.

Key Metrics Unveiled
This project sheds light on crucial metrics essential for success in the hospitality industry:

**ADR (Average Daily Revenue)**: The average payment for rooms sold in a given time period.

**DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights)**: The average number of rooms booked per day during a time period.

**DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)**: The average number of rooms available for sale per day during a time period.

**DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights)**: The average number of rooms successfully used by customers per day during a time period.

**Occupancy Percentage**: The percentage of successfully booked rooms out of the total available capacity.

**No-Show Rate**: The percentage of customers who fail to show up for their bookings.

**Realization Percentage**: The percentage of successfully checked out bookings over all bookings made.

A Path to Success

It identifies opportunities to improve pricing, implement cost-cutting strategies, and drive revenue growth. The project focuses on two cities and a specific hotel, enabling targeted interventions.
